      A Multi-Faceted Exploration of how design and technology intersect with the human condition.
      We invite you to join us, the MFA Design + Technology class of 2019, as we showcase our works-in-progress from our first-semester Thesis Studios. It will be an unforgettable afternoon of testing the first full iterations of our thesis projects. Be ready for some unexpected interactions, food, drinks and a ton of inspiration!
      Students, professors, alumni, folks from the industry, fields of research - you are all welcome! Guests are welcome!
      This event is free. Refreshments will be served.
